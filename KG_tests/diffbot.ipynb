This study proposes the use of neural networks, specifically NARX \\nnetworks, in the modeling of no n-linear chemical systems with the use of the \\ncontrol field systems identification methodology. The chemical reactor of the \\nTennessee Eastman, responsible for the greater non -linearities of the plant, is \\nstudied. First, a simple decentralized control schem e is proposed for the        \\nstabilization of the plant, an identification experiment is designed, and two            \\nsub-models are trained for the level and pressure of the reactor, obtaining      \\nsatisfactory results.  \\nKeywords:  Tennesse Eastman, neural networks, NARX, systems  identification, \\nnon-linear systems  \\n1 Introduction  \\nIn recent years, great attention has been paid to the modeling and identification of \\nnon-linear systems, because all real processes present non -linearities to some degree. \\nThe classical approach to this problem for years was to obtain linear models that we re \\nquite representative of the systems to be modeled, but there are cases in which non -\\nlinearities can cause significant errors in the identification problem. For this reason, \\nseveral machine learning techniques and especially neural networks have been an \\nimportant tool in recent years for the modeling of non -linear systems. In this work, \\nthe case of study is the Tennessee Eastman (TE) plant. This plant has been the object \\nof study for 27 years and numerous investigations of various kinds have been       \\ndeveloped on it. In [3] linear ARX, impulse response and state space models such as \\nN4SID and CVA were identified, the latter being the best results. In [4] models of the \\nplant reactor based on different structures of artificial neural networks trained by  \\nregression and the Levenberg -Marquardt (LM) algorithm were identified to compare \\ntheir effectiveness when used in Model -based Predictive Controllers (MPC). In [5] \\nstate space models such as MOESP, N4SID and ORT were identified and compared. \\nIn [6] Genetic P rogramming was used to obtain a model of the plant reactor. In [7] a \\ngray model of ET was obtained by modeling some variables by basic principles and \\nothers by identifying HAMMERSTEIN -WIENER models. In [8] a model based on a ', metadata={'source': '../VTKG/Identification of non-linear chemical systems with neural networks.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In [9] a model based on neural networks trained with bio -inspired         \\nalgorithms such as the Bat Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Bee Colony Algorithm \\nwas identified. In [10] a Digital Twin  of the complete plant is obtained for monitoring \\nand control. In [2], [11] and [12] decentralized control strategies are developed to \\nstabilize and control the entire plant. In [13] a model of the reactor -separator of the \\nplant is developed in the object -oriented modeling language Modelica.  \\nAlthough in [4], [8] and [9] good models based on neural networks are obtained for \\nthe reactor of the TE plant, there is a lack of clarity in the obtaining process. For  \\nexample, there is no explanation about the selec tion of input and output variables, and \\nsome that contribute to the dynamics of the system are ignored, such as reactant \\nflows. According to [1] the TE plant is open -loop unstable , which is why an         \\nexperiment cannot be carried out without its prior stabilization. This topic will be \\nbetter explained in the next section, but it represents an important step in the         \\nidentification process.  In [4], [8] and [9] the authors are able to obtain a large data set, \\nwithout giving  an explanation  of the top ic, which leads to a lack of clarity in the   \\nassumptions, su ch as the operating conditions  of the plant, this analysis is very     \\nimportant, because they are the conditions in which the obtained models will be valid \\nfor use. In addition, questions about the design of the experiment such as the type of \\nsignals used or their parameters are not specified, it is not taken into account whether \\nthe data sufficiently reflect the transient and stable dynamics of the plant. No        \\nexplanation is offered on the selected neural network structure and regarding the  \\nvalidation of the obtained models, according to [15], it is necessary to perform a   \\nresidual analysis, in addition to the fit indices such as the MSE and others.  In the field \\nof modeling and systems  identification , the quantitative validity given by the        \\nadjustment of the obtained models is as important as the qualitative validity   reflected \\nin the preparation and rigor of the obtaining method. For these reasons, the objective \\nof this work is to o btain models based on neural networks in a case study process, the \\nTE plant, using the systems identification methodology to detail the process  and  \\nguarantee the validity of the models.  \\n2 TE Process  \\nThe Tennessee Eastman plant, was published in [1] as a sim ulation process for     \\nacademic research. The TE process is a highly non -linear chemical process, created \\nby a real system, with slight changes made to protect the identity of reactants and \\nproducts, and features up to 6 modes of operation. This system is  a reference problem \\nfor the process control community, providing a realistic simulation of a chemical \\nindustrial process of interest for analysis, control, monitoring and identification of \\nsystems. The process shown in Fig.1 consists mainly of five operat ing units: a       \\ntwo-phase reactor, a condenser, a recycle compressor, a vapor -liquid separator, and a \\ndistillation column. The process has eight components, including four gaseous     \\nreactants (A, C, D, and E), two liquid products (G and H), an inert c omponent (B), \\nand a byproduct (F). As explained in [1] all reactions are irreversible and exothermic.    ', metadata={'source': '../VTKG/Identification of non-linear chemical systems with neural networks.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The gaseous reactants feed into the reactor, where they react to form \\nthe two products. Gas phase reactions are catalyzed by a non -volatile catalyst       \\ndissolved in the liquid phase. The reactor has an internal cooling system to remove the \\nheat of the reaction. The products leave the reactor as vapor along with the reactants \\nthat did not react while the catalyst remains in the reactor. The product stream f rom \\nthe reactor passes through a condenser and from there to a vapor -liquid separator. The \\nnon-condensed components are recycled through a centrifugal compressor to the  \\nreactor feed. The condensed components are moved towards a distillation column to \\nremo ve the reagent residues, distilling them together with the reagent C feed.      \\nProducts G and H exit the column towards a refining section that  is not part of the \\nprocess. By product F is primarily purged from the system as steam in the separator. \\nThe comp lete plant has 12 manipulated variables, and 41 measured, continuous and \\ndiscrete variables.

In \\norder to generate an input -output data set to identify a process model, it is first      \\nnecessary to stabilize the plant, since it is open -loop unstable and has restrictions that \\nwhen violated, the process stops immediately. The control strategy must prevent these \\nrestrictions from being violated while the plant is distur bed by excitation at the inputs . \\nThis model can then be used as the basis for a Model -based Predictive Controller, \\nwhich would act at the supervisory level.

System  identification methodology . \\n3.1 Experiment design.  \\nIn order to carry out the experiment for identification, it is necessary to know the \\nexcitation limits of the inputs, as well as the time constants of the system. To do this, \\na simple experiment i s carried out, in which one input is varied at a time with a    \\npositive and a negative step, each with a duration of 5 hours. In order not to violate \\nthe plant's restrictions, the inputs will be varied to ±10% of their value in Mode 1, \\nexcept for the pres sure reference in the reactor, which is the most critical, this will be \\nvaried by ±100 kPa. Fig.3 shows the response of the system outputs to a stimulus in \\nthe D and A flows, and in the pressure and level references. The experiment illustrates \\nthe variety in terms of time constants of the system. It is concluded that a pulse width \\nof 5 hours is sufficient to capture the transient and stable dynamics of the system and \\nthat, for the chosen variations in the inputs, the outputs are far from violating any \\nrestriction. There is a risk that by stimulating all the inputs at the same time the    \\nvariations in the outputs will be much larger, for this reason values relatively close to \\nthe operating point were chosen. It is very difficult to incorporate knowledge in to a \\nneural network, therefore, the quality of the network is dependent on the data used to \\ntrain it. The training data must cover the entire range of inputs for which the network \\nwill be used, because neural networks, like other nonlinear black box models , do not        \\nextrapolate well. To comply with the above, the data for identification were generated \\nby stimulating the manipulated variables with 'skyline' functions, with the maximum \\nvariations mentioned above and pulse width of 5 hours.  \\n\", metadata={'source': '../VTKG/Identification of non-linear chemical systems with neural networks.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

It is a great task to study in depth the characteristics,   \\nadvantages and disadvantages of e ach structure in each situation. According to   \\nChapter 14 of [15] neural networks can be classified into static and dynamic. Static \\nare networks in which the output is calculated directly from the inputs through direct \\nconnections. In dynamic networks, th e output depends not only on the current input of \\nthe network, but also on the previous inputs, outputs or states of the network.        \\nDynamic networks  are networks that contain 'delays', or integrators in the case of \\ncontinuous inputs, and operate with an input sequence. These dynamic networks can \\nhave only direct connections, or they can also have feedback connections, the latter \\ntype are known as recurrent neural networks. As dynamic networks have 'memory' \\nthey can be trained to learn patterns that var y over time, that is, they can approximate \\ndynamic system s. This type of problem in the machine l earni ng branch of study is \\nknown as time series a nalysis , which, taken to the field of control t heory, is the    \\nsystems  identification . There is a great varie ty of architectures for recurr ent neural \\nnetworks, depending on their direct and feedback connections, the number of internal \\nlayers, etc. Among them the Hopfield network explained in Chapter 21 of [15], the \\nfully connected recurring networks, the short an d long -term memory network widely \\nused in the field of speech recognition, t he Elman network, used in [16] t o model an \\ninternal combustion engine, the nonlinear autoregressive network with external inputs \\nNARX, which is explained in chapter 27 of [15] and in [17] used to identify the   \\nmodel of a distillation column.  The NARXs  are recurr ent neural  networks with delays \\nin the input connections and in the fee dback connections of the output , therefore, they \\nhave a structure that facilitates learning the behavi or of dynamic systems.

The parameters  were  obtained after performing several \\niterations of the methodology in Fig.2 until satisfactory results were obtained.  In [4], \\n[8] and [9] recurr ent networks are used where only th e last output is fed back. The \\nstructure selected in this work is superior because dynamic systems depend on both \\npast outputs and past inputs, and by using several delays in both, better performance \\nis expected in the time series analysis problem.  \\n3.4 Estimat ion of parameters, application of algorithms.  \\nThe networks were trained with the Levenberg -Marquardt algorithm using the Neural \\nNetworks ToolBox of the MATLAB version R2015a software. To train each network, \\na 200 -hour fragment of the data set obtained and pretreated was chosen. Each network \\nwas trained a total of 5 times to avoid the local optimum problem and training was \\nstopped when the performance of the network calculated by the least squared error \\nstopped improving significantly.  \\n3.5 Validation.  \\nFor model identification or prediction problems, it is convenient to perform an     \\nanalysis of prediction residuals or errors. The residues cannot be related to each other, \\nnor to the sequence of the entries. For this, the autocorrelation function and the    \\ncross -correlation function are used. Fig.6  shows the autocorrelation graphs of the \\nresiduals for the two networks and i n Fig.7  the cross -correlation of the residuals with \\nthe inputs. For the residuals to be unrelated, the autocorrelation function must give an \\nimpulse at the instant Ƭ = 0 and the rest of the values be within the confidence interval \\ndenoted by the dashed l ines, i n Fig.6  it is observed that this is not fulfilled at all,   \\nalthough it is an acceptable result for this type of problem. For the cross correlation, \\nthe residuals must be within the confide nce interval at all times. Fig.7  shows that this \\nis true for the tw o networks. In order to validate whether a black box model is      \\nrepresentative of the system that was identified, it is vital to perform a                  \\ncross -validation, that is, to analyze the behavior of the model in the face of a different \\ndata s et than the one u sed for training. Fig.8 and Fig.9  show the behavior of the two \\nnetworks for 100 hours of data , different from those used during training. Table 3 \\nshows the calculation of the percentage of fit (FIT) and the mean square er ror (MSE) \\nof the m odels and their analogues  with the best results in [8] and [9], the BSA and the \\nANN -BA respectively . As can be seen, the models obtained in this work have     \\ncompetitive results, despite the global optimization techniques used for training the \\nnetworks in  [8] and [9]. This is mainly due to the work carried out throughout the \\nidentification process, from the selection of the input variables, the design of the  \\nexperiment and the selection of a better neural network structure.

Specifically, a            \\ndecentralized control was implemented to stabilize the plant, an identification       \\nexperiment was carried out to obtain the data with which two recurrent neural      \\nnetworks of the NARX type were trained to model the level and pressure in the     \\nreacto r. The models obtained present good results . This work shows that rigor and \\npreparation in the system identification process not only gives qualitative validity to \\nthe resulting models, but also direct ly influences their performance . This paper  will \\nserve as the basis, for the authors, in future studies on the main problems when using \\nneura l networks as models of dynamic systems: the lack of generalization, local   \\nminimums in the training process and the lack of tools to incorporate the physical \\nknowledge of the system in the models.  \\n5 References  \\n1.

This study proposes the use of neural networks, specifically NARX \\nnetworks, in the modeling of no n-linear chemical systems with the use of the \\ncontrol field systems identification methodology. The chemical reactor of the \\nTennessee Eastman, responsible for the greater non -linearities of the plant, is \\nstudied. First, a simple decentralized control schem e is proposed for the        \\nstabilization of the plant, an identification experiment is designed, and two            \\nsub-models are trained for the level and pressure of the reactor, obtaining      \\nsatisfactory results.  \\nKeywords:  Tennesse Eastman, neural networks, NARX, systems  identification, \\nnon-linear systems  \\n1 Introduction  \\nIn recent years, great attention has been paid to the modeling and identification of \\nnon-linear systems, because all real processes present non -linearities to some degree. \\nThe classical approach to this problem for years was to obtain linear models that we re \\nquite representative of the systems to be modeled, but there are cases in which non -\\nlinearities can cause significant errors in the identification problem. For this reason, \\nseveral machine learning techniques and especially neural networks have been an \\nimportant tool in recent years for the modeling of non -linear systems. In this work, \\nthe case of study is the Tennessee Eastman (TE) plant. This plant has been the object \\nof study for 27 years and numerous investigations of various kinds have been       \\ndeveloped on it. In [3] linear ARX, impulse response and state space models such as \\nN4SID and CVA were identified, the latter being the best results. In [4] models of the \\nplant reactor based on different structures of artificial neural networks trained by  \\nregression and the Levenberg -Marquardt (LM) algorithm were identified to compare \\ntheir effectiveness when used in Model -based Predictive Controllers (MPC). In [5] \\nstate space models such as MOESP, N4SID and ORT were identified and compared. \\nIn [6] Genetic P rogramming was used to obtain a model of the plant reactor. In [7] a \\ngray model of ET was obtained by modeling some variables by basic principles and \\nothers by identifying HAMMERSTEIN -WIENER models. In [8] a model based on a ', metadata={'source': '../VTKG/Identification of non-linear chemical systems with neural networks.pdf', 'page': 0, 'id': 'b8e15c852fa9518fdb585ec1c5164e02'})),\n",

In [9] a model based on neural networks trained with bio -inspired         \\nalgorithms such as the Bat Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Bee Colony Algorithm \\nwas identified. In [10] a Digital Twin  of the complete plant is obtained for monitoring \\nand control. In [2], [11] and [12] decentralized control strategies are developed to \\nstabilize and control the entire plant. In [13] a model of the reactor -separator of the \\nplant is developed in the object -oriented modeling language Modelica.  \\nAlthough in [4], [8] and [9] good models based on neural networks are obtained for \\nthe reactor of the TE plant, there is a lack of clarity in the obtaining process. For  \\nexample, there is no explanation about the selec tion of input and output variables, and \\nsome that contribute to the dynamics of the system are ignored, such as reactant \\nflows. According to [1] the TE plant is open -loop unstable , which is why an         \\nexperiment cannot be carried out without its prior stabilization. This topic will be \\nbetter explained in the next section, but it represents an important step in the         \\nidentification process.  In [4], [8] and [9] the authors are able to obtain a large data set, \\nwithout giving  an explanation  of the top ic, which leads to a lack of clarity in the   \\nassumptions, su ch as the operating conditions  of the plant, this analysis is very     \\nimportant, because they are the conditions in which the obtained models will be valid \\nfor use. In addition, questions about the design of the experiment such as the type of \\nsignals used or their parameters are not specified, it is not taken into account whether \\nthe data sufficiently reflect the transient and stable dynamics of the plant. No        \\nexplanation is offered on the selected neural network structure and regarding the  \\nvalidation of the obtained models, according to [15], it is necessary to perform a   \\nresidual analysis, in addition to the fit indices such as the MSE and others.  In the field \\nof modeling and systems  identification , the quantitative validity given by the        \\nadjustment of the obtained models is as important as the qualitative validity   reflected \\nin the preparation and rigor of the obtaining method. For these reasons, the objective \\nof this work is to o btain models based on neural networks in a case study process, the \\nTE plant, using the systems identification methodology to detail the process  and  \\nguarantee the validity of the models.  \\n2 TE Process  \\nThe Tennessee Eastman plant, was published in [1] as a sim ulation process for     \\nacademic research. The TE process is a highly non -linear chemical process, created \\nby a real system, with slight changes made to protect the identity of reactants and \\nproducts, and features up to 6 modes of operation. This system is  a reference problem \\nfor the process control community, providing a realistic simulation of a chemical \\nindustrial process of interest for analysis, control, monitoring and identification of \\nsystems. The process shown in Fig.1 consists mainly of five operat ing units: a       \\ntwo-phase reactor, a condenser, a recycle compressor, a vapor -liquid separator, and a \\ndistillation column. The process has eight components, including four gaseous     \\nreactants (A, C, D, and E), two liquid products (G and H), an inert c omponent (B), \\nand a byproduct (F). As explained in [1] all reactions are irreversible and exothermic.

The gaseous reactants feed into the reactor, where they react to form \\nthe two products. Gas phase reactions are catalyzed by a non -volatile catalyst       \\ndissolved in the liquid phase. The reactor has an internal cooling system to remove the \\nheat of the reaction. The products leave the reactor as vapor along with the reactants \\nthat did not react while the catalyst remains in the reactor.

The \\nnon-condensed components are recycled through a centrifugal compressor to the  \\nreactor feed. The condensed components are moved towards a distillation column to \\nremo ve the reagent residues, distilling them together with the reagent C feed.      \\nProducts G and H exit the column towards a refining section that  is not part of the \\nprocess.

System  identification methodology . \\n3.1 Experiment design.  \\nIn order to carry out the experiment for identification, it is necessary to know the \\nexcitation limits of the inputs, as well as the time constants of the system. To do this, \\na simple experiment i s carried out, in which one input is varied at a time with a    \\npositive and a negative step, each with a duration of 5 hours. In order not to violate \\nthe plant's restrictions, the inputs will be varied to ±10% of their value in Mode 1, \\nexcept for the pres sure reference in the reactor, which is the most critical, this will be \\nvaried by ±100 kPa. Fig.3 shows the response of the system outputs to a stimulus in \\nthe D and A flows, and in the pressure and level references. The experiment illustrates \\nthe variety in terms of time constants of the system. It is concluded that a pulse width \\nof 5 hours is sufficient to capture the transient and stable dynamics of the system and \\nthat, for the chosen variations in the inputs, the outputs are far from violating any \\nrestriction. There is a risk that by stimulating all the inputs at the same time the    \\nvariations in the outputs will be much larger, for this reason values relatively close to \\nthe operating point were chosen. It is very difficult to incorporate knowledge in to a \\nneural network, therefore, the quality of the network is dependent on the data used to \\ntrain it. The training data must cover the entire range of inputs for which the network \\nwill be used, because neural networks, like other nonlinear black box models , do not        \\nextrapolate well. To comply with the above, the data for identification were generated \\nby stimulating the manipulated variables with 'skyline' functions, with the maximum \\nvariations mentioned above and pulse width of 5 hours.  \\n\", metadata={'source': '../VTKG/Identification of non-linear chemical systems with neural networks.pdf', 'page': 4, 'id': '7e374e04027eec4191de389d73b49f84'})),\n",

It is a great task to study in depth the characteristics,   \\nadvantages and disadvantages of e ach structure in each situation. According to   \\nChapter 14 of [15] neural networks can be classified into static and dynamic. Static \\nare networks in which the output is calculated directly from the inputs through direct \\nconnections. In dynamic networks, th e output depends not only on the current input of \\nthe network, but also on the previous inputs, outputs or states of the network.        \\nDynamic networks  are networks that contain 'delays', or integrators in the case of \\ncontinuous inputs, and operate with an input sequence. These dynamic networks can \\nhave only direct connections, or they can also have feedback connections, the latter \\ntype are known as recurrent neural networks. As dynamic networks have 'memory' \\nthey can be trained to learn patterns that var y over time, that is, they can approximate \\ndynamic system s. This type of problem in the machine l earni ng branch of study is \\nknown as time series a nalysis , which, taken to the field of control t heory, is the    \\nsystems  identification . There is a great varie ty of architectures for recurr ent neural \\nnetworks, depending on their direct and feedback connections, the number of internal \\nlayers, etc. Among them the Hopfield network explained in Chapter 21 of [15], the \\nfully connected recurring networks, the short an d long -term memory network widely \\nused in the field of speech recognition, t he Elman network, used in [16] t o model an \\ninternal combustion engine, the nonlinear autoregressive network with external inputs \\nNARX, which is explained in chapter 27 of [15] and in [17] used to identify the   \\nmodel of a distillation column.  The NARXs  are recurr ent neural  networks with delays \\nin the input connections and in the fee dback connections of the output , therefore, they \\nhave a structure that facilitates learning the behavi or of dynamic systems.  In this \\nwork, two NARXs will be used to model the pressure and level of the reactor.

The parameters  were  obtained after performing several \\niterations of the methodology in Fig.2 until satisfactory results were obtained.  In [4], \\n[8] and [9] recurr ent networks are used where only th e last output is fed back. The \\nstructure selected in this work is superior because dynamic systems depend on both \\npast outputs and past inputs, and by using several delays in both, better performance \\nis expected in the time series analysis problem.  \\n3.4 Estimat ion of parameters, application of algorithms.  \\nThe networks were trained with the Levenberg -Marquardt algorithm using the Neural \\nNetworks ToolBox of the MATLAB version R2015a software. To train each network, \\na 200 -hour fragment of the data set obtained and pretreated was chosen. Each network \\nwas trained a total of 5 times to avoid the local optimum problem and training was \\nstopped when the performance of the network calculated by the least squared error \\nstopped improving significantly.  \\n3.5 Validation.  \\nFor model identification or prediction problems, it is convenient to perform an     \\nanalysis of prediction residuals or errors. The residues cannot be related to each other, \\nnor to the sequence of the entries. For this, the autocorrelation function and the    \\ncross -correlation function are used. Fig.6  shows the autocorrelation graphs of the \\nresiduals for the two networks and i n Fig.7  the cross -correlation of the residuals with \\nthe inputs. For the residuals to be unrelated, the autocorrelation function must give an \\nimpulse at the instant Ƭ = 0 and the rest of the values be within the confidence interval \\ndenoted by the dashed l ines, i n Fig.6  it is observed that this is not fulfilled at all,   \\nalthough it is an acceptable result for this type of problem. For the cross correlation, \\nthe residuals must be within the confide nce interval at all times. Fig.7  shows that this \\nis true for the tw o networks. In order to validate whether a black box model is      \\nrepresentative of the system that was identified, it is vital to perform a                  \\ncross -validation, that is, to analyze the behavior of the model in the face of a different \\ndata s et than the one u sed for training. Fig.8 and Fig.9  show the behavior of the two \\nnetworks for 100 hours of data , different from those used during training. Table 3 \\nshows the calculation of the percentage of fit (FIT) and the mean square er ror (MSE) \\nof the m odels and their analogues  with the best results in [8] and [9], the BSA and the \\nANN -BA respectively . As can be seen, the models obtained in this work have     \\ncompetitive results, despite the global optimization techniques used for training the \\nnetworks in  [8] and [9]. This is mainly due to the work carried out throughout the \\nidentification process, from the selection of the input variables, the design of the  \\nexperiment and the selection of a better neural network structure.

The models obtained present good results . This work shows that rigor and \\npreparation in the system identification process not only gives qualitative validity to \\nthe resulting models, but also direct ly influences their performance . This paper  will \\nserve as the basis, for the authors, in future studies on the main problems when using \\nneura l networks as models of dynamic systems: the lack of generalization, local   \\nminimums in the training process and the lack of tools to incorporate the physical \\nknowledge of the system in the models.  \\n5 References  \\n1.
